Big O Analysis:

Our runtime's average performance runs at about O(N^2) as a result of a nested for loop. The outer loop runs through the array N times. The inner loop goes runs through each element in the array N/2 times, from 1 - N. N divided by the nmber of elements gives you order N. When we multiply N and N/2 we get a runtime of O(N^2).
